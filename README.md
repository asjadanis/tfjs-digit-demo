This project was bootstrapped with [react-redux-boilerplate](https://github.com/asjadanis/react-redux-boilerplate).

## Tensorflow JS - Digit Recognition

A simplistic boilerplate based on create-react-app, pre-configured with [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), [redux-devtools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools), [redux-logger](https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger) & [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) to quickly get started with protyping and POC's without having to configure these essential tools everytime you bootstrap a project.
